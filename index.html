        <h1>K.U.S.H</h1>
        <h4>Cypress Hill</h4>
        <p> I'm the original Dr. Greenthumb, the rest are liers
            <br>I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
            <br>I got every type of weed that you might desire
            <br>Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
            <br>Any kind of flavor you savor
            <br>I can do you the favor
            <br>Just as long as you share with your neighbor
            <br>Some like the "SourD", that's an east coast way
            <br>But on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen
            <br>Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
            <br>I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
            <br><span class="nostress">Git commit, git push, I'm pushing the KUSH</span>
            <br>When I harvest I put a "K" on the bag, like the Nike swoosh
            <br>All over the world, in case you wonder
            <br>I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter
            <br>But no one does it better like we do in Cali
            <br>Just ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the...
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
            <br>The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
            <br>The more I smoke, the high I get
            <br>The better I feel, I can't quit
            <br>The more I smoke, the high I get
            <br>The better I feel, I can't quit
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>Cottonmouth Kings are down with us
            <br>Snoop Dogg and Dre are down with us
            <br>Cheech and Chong, they're down with us
            <br>But the DEA, they can get the nuts
            <br>On a HighTimes cover, you might see us
            <br>Taking hits from the bong with the aprons on
            <br>With weed so strong, that knockout King Kong
            <br>Hit it one good time... Your mind's gone
            <br>Your eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry
            <br>Just hit me when you want more and I'll supply
            <br>Red(man) and Meth(odman) said let's gets stoned. I said "How High?"
            <br>They said high enough to touch God and kiss the sky
            <br>That's a tall order, but I think I got what you need
            <br>I got the food for thought and I'm ready to feed
            <br>So, follow my lead I got the gifts to bring
            <br>It's an everyday life for the Reefer King
