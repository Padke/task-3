        <h4>Cypress Hill</h4>
        <p> I'm the original Dr. Greenthumb, the rest are liers
            I'm the one with the prescription to get you higher
            I got every type of weed that you might desire
            Go ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired
            Any kind of flavor you savor
            I can do you the favor
            Just as long as you share with your neighbor
            Some like the "SourD", that's an east coast way
            But on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen
            Some of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky
            I throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky
            <span class="nostress">No stress, no bush, I'm pushing the KUSH1</span>
            When I harvest I put a "K" on the bag, like the Nike swoosh
            All over the world, in case you wonder
            I smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter
            But no one does it better like we do in Cali
            Just ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the...

        <p>
            K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
        The K.U.S.H. keeps us so high
        The more I smoke, the high I get
        The better I feel, I can't quit
        The more I smoke, the high I get
        The better I feel, I can't quit
        </p>
